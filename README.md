Greetings! Welcome to the Battleship game. To begin, kindly provide your name or a nickname. This information will be stored in the database (record.txt file) along with your score, which represents the number of attempts made to emerge victorious.

Here are some hints for gameplay: "-" indicates an untouched cell on the field, "" signifies a missed attempt, and "x" denotes a successful hit on a ship. Upon hitting a ship, it's partially sunk. As the ship progressively sinks, it will be marked as "*", and the adjacent area will also be marked with "*," simplifying the game. Upon winning, you'll have the option to either start a new game or exit. Should you choose to exit, your name and score will be logged in the database.

Enjoy playing the game!
